The tank and all moving enemies move either horizontally or vertically. There are obstacles like walls and rocks. Some prevent movement in the given direction, others also block visibility. Obstacles can be destroyed or indestructible.
There are different types of enemies, some stationary and others moving. They are all able to shoot at the player. There are different classes of enemies with different abilities and properties.
